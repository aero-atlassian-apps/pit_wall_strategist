# PRODUCT VISION BOARD
**Project:** The Pit Wall Strategist
**Methodology:** Roman Pichler's Product Vision Board

---

## 1. VISION
**"To empower software teams with the proactive intelligence of an F1 Race Engineer, transforming every sprint from a chaotic scramble into a calculated victory."**

---

## 2. TARGET GROUP
**Who are the users?**
1.  **The Scrum Master / Team Lead:** Needs real-time situational awareness without digging through 50 browser tabs.
2.  **The Developer:** Needs protection from burnout and clear, actionable signals on what to prioritize.
3.  **The Product Manager:** Needs to know the "Pace" (Velocity) and "Fuel" (WIP) status at a glance.

**Key Characteristics:**
*   Users of Jira Software Cloud.
*   Teams practicing Agile (Scrum or Kanban).
*   Teams feeling "data overload" or "meeting fatigue".

## 3. NEEDS
**What problem is the product solving?**
*   **The "Passive Dashboard" Problem:** Most Jira dashboards are static graveyards of charts that nobody looks at until it's too late.
*   **The "Silent Stalling" Problem:** Tickets sitting in "In Progress" for days without updates, invisible until the Daily Standup.
*   **The "Burnout" Problem:** High performers silently taking on too much work while others are blocked.
*   **The "Context Switching" Cost:** Constantly switching between Jira, GitHub, and Slack to gauge progress.

## 4. PRODUCT
**What is the product?**
*   **A "Mission Control" Interface:** Visceral, F1-themed Custom UI that visualizes work as a physical race on a circuit.
*   **An Agentic Co-Pilot (Rovo):** Not just a reporter, but an active participant that suggests strategies ("Splitting tickets", "Reassigning") when things go wrong.
*   **Real-Time Telemetry:** Live monitoring of Lead Time (Lap Time) and Cycle Time (Sector Pace) combined with DevOps signals (Commits).

**Unique Value Proposition:**
"Jira tells you *what* happened yesterday. The Pit Wall Strategist tells you *what to do* right now."

## 5. BUSINESS GOALS
**Why are we building it?**
1.  **Win Codegeist 2025:** Demonstrate the power of Forge + Rovo + Custom UI.
2.  **Market Differentiation:** Break the mold of "boring business apps" with a gamified, high-stakes aesthetic that developers actually enjoy using.
3.  **Adoption Strategy:** "Trojan Horse" adoption — start as a cool dashboard for the Retro, become the daily driver for the Standup.
