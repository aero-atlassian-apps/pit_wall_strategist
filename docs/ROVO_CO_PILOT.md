# Pit Wall Strategist — Rovo Co-Pilot

## Your Race Engineer, Not a Chatbot

---

## The Difference

Most AI assistants are chatbots. You ask a question, you get an answer.

**Rovo in Pit Wall is different.**

Rovo is your **Race Engineer** — a context-aware co-pilot that:
- **Knows your context** — project type, board strategy, sprint state
- **Knows your metrics** — WIP, velocity, stalled tickets, burnout risk
- **Explains what matters** — not just data, but significance
- **Helps you decide what to do next** — actionable recommendations

---

## The Key Insight

> **"You don't ask Rovo for data. You ask it what to do next."**

Traditional AI: "What are my sprint metrics?"  
Race Engineer: "We're 3 days into the sprint with 40% velocity. Two tickets are approaching stall. Should I flag them?"

Traditional AI: "Show me cycle time."  
Race Engineer: "Code Review is your bottleneck — 65% of WIP is stuck there. Consider adding pit crew to clear the backlog."

## The 10 Pit Strategies

When Rovo identifies a problem, it doesn't just report — it can **act**.

| Strategy | F1 Name | What It Does |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `split-ticket` | THE UNDERCUT | Breaks large tickets into focused subtasks |
| `reassign-ticket` | TEAM ORDERS | Hands off to driver with fresh capacity |
| `defer-ticket` | RETIRE CAR | Moves to backlog when ROI is negative |
| `change-priority` | BLUE FLAG | Escalates critical path items |
| `transition-issue` | PUSH TO LIMIT | Forces transition to next status |
| `add-blocker-flag` | RED FLAG | Marks blocked, triggers incident response |
| `link-issues` | SLIPSTREAM | Connects related issues for visibility |
| `update-estimate` | FUEL ADJUSTMENT | Recalibrates points based on new info |
| `add-radio-message` | RADIO MESSAGE | Broadcasts strategic comment to team |
| `create-subtask` | PIT CREW TASK | Assigns specific action to crew member |

## Context-Aware Intelligence

Rovo doesn't show all 10 actions for every ticket. The **Strategy Intelligence Engine** filters by:

- **Board Type**: Scrum-specific vs Kanban-specific actions
- **Issue State**: Different recommendations for stalled vs in-progress
- **Priority**: High-priority tickets won't see "RETIRE CAR"
- **Story Points**: Large items trigger "THE UNDERCUT"
- **Sprint Timeline**: Days remaining affect urgency

**Result:** Only relevant actions, with clear reasoning why.

## Dual AI Modes

Pit Wall offers two AI interaction patterns:

### 1. Rovo Agent (LLM-Powered)
- Full natural language conversation
- Complex analysis and explanations
- Executes all 10 strategic actions
- Available in Jira's AI sidebar

### 2. Expert System (Embedded)
- Instant responses, no external AI calls
- Pattern-matched analytics queries
- Built into the dashboard
- Works offline, zero latency

**Both modes share the same context awareness.**

## The Race Engineer Promise

In F1, the Race Engineer is the voice in the driver's ear. They:
- Monitor 300+ telemetry channels
- Predict tire degradation curves
- Calculate optimal pit windows
- Make split-second strategy calls

Rovo as your Race Engineer does the same for sprints:
- Monitors all ticket states
- Predicts stall risk before it happens
- Calculates sprint completion probability
- Recommends specific, executable actions
